### Intro

Since there are now recent offerings in undergraduate Data Science, I decided to take it. Eventually, it was a great decision for me to grasp this career.

It's been a while since I had some contributions here in GitHub. I'll start to push my personal projects soon now that I finally graduated.

### Contributions

I'm not active in Github as much as others but I do post some data analysis and cool insights when I found one. I'll update this README once I got things prepared here.
