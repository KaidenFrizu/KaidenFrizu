### Intro

Since there are now recent offerings in undergraduate Data Science, I decided to take it. Eventually, it was a great decision for me to grasp this career.

I haven't done so much data analysis since I'm too busy finishing homeworks, but when I do, I try to finish it as soon as possible. Self-motivation is what drives me to learn new things despite the current events.

### Commonly Used Languages

I mainly use R as my primary language for documentation and static data analysis. For Machine Learning and Real-time data analysis and visualization, I use Python. I also have some basic knowledge in MATLAB since my university specializes at that language.
